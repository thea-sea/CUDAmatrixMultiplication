# CUDAmatrixMultiplication
- A demo project on CUDA Tiled Matrix Computation, Shared Memory
- In this project, I learnt how to use shared memory to write more efficient
kernel functions.


1. Correct usage of CUDA library calls and C extensions
2. Correct usage of thread idâ€™s in matrix computation.
